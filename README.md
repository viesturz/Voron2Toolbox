# Voron2Toolbox

Distribute canbus, power and filament to muiltiple toolheads on Voron2. Support both Stealthburner and Mini Stealthburner toolheads.

## Building

Most parts are ABS, with some TPU for flexibility.

1mm piano wire is used to shape the first half of each umbilical. The second half is free floating.

Use mini stealthburner canboard mounts from [KayosMaker](https://github.com/KayosMaker/CANboard_Mounts).

See [Canbus wiring](./canbus_wiring.md) on how to wire up canbus.

## Known issues - being worked on

* Tricky to get the piano wire bend angle right.
* Mini SB ubmilical sometimes braushes against other extruders.
